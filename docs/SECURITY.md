# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Avila Protocol implements a comprehensive security model to protect user funds, ensure system integrity, and prevent malicious attacks. This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and audit considerations.

## Security Model

### 1. Access Control

#### Role-Based Permissions

```move
// Admin roles for each module
Oracle Admin: Controls price updaters and oracle parameters
Factory Admin: Controls option creation parameters and creators
Vault Admin: Controls collateral requirements and vault parameters
Settlement Admin: Controls settlement fees and liquidation procedures
```

#### Authorization Checks

- All admin functions require proper authorization
- Price updates restricted to authorized updaters
- Option creation limited to authorized creators
- Position operations require ownership validation

### 2. Input Validation

#### Parameter Validation

```move
// Example validation patterns
assert!(strike_price > 0, E_INVALID_STRIKE_PRICE);
assert!(expiration > timestamp::now_seconds(), E_INVALID_EXPIRATION);
assert!(amount > 0, E_INVALID_AMOUNT);
assert!(option_type == OPTION_TYPE_CALL || option_type == OPTION_TYPE_PUT, E_INVALID_OPTION_TYPE);
```

#### Business Logic Validation

- Collateral requirements (150% margin)
- Price staleness checks (30-minute max age)
- Expiration validation before operations
- Settlement profitability checks

### 3. Economic Security

#### Collateral Management

- **Margin Requirements**: 150% collateral requirement
- **Liquidation Protection**: Automated margin calls
- **Collateral Locking**: Funds locked until position closure
- **Premium Collection**: Upfront premium payments

#### Price Protection

- **Oracle Security**: Multiple authorized price sources
- **Staleness Protection**: 30-minute maximum price age
- **Price Validation**: Reasonable price range checks
- **Update Frequency**: Regular price updates required

### 4. Reentrancy Protection

The protocol uses Move's built-in reentrancy protection through:
- Resource-based state management
- Atomic operations
- No external calls during state changes

### 5. Overflow/Underflow Protection

Move provides automatic overflow/underflow protection, but additional checks are implemented:

```move
// Example overflow protection
let new_total = total_supply + amount;
assert!(new_total >= total_supply, E_OVERFLOW);
```

## Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### 1. Oracle Manipulation

**Risk**: Malicious price updates affecting option valuations

**Mitigations**:
- Multiple authorized price sources
- Price staleness requirements
- Admin controls for updater management
- Event logging for all price changes

### 2. Collateral Attacks

**Risk**: Insufficient collateral leading to system losses

**Mitigations**:
- 150% margin requirement
- Real-time collateral validation
- Automated liquidation procedures
- Position size limits

### 3. Expiration Attacks

**Risk**: Manipulation of option expiration timing

**Mitigations**:
- Timestamp validation
- Expiration checks before operations
- Clear expiration event logging
- Automated settlement procedures

### 4. Settlement Attacks

**Risk**: Unauthorized or incorrect settlements

**Mitigations**:
- Authorization checks for settlement
- Profitability validation
- Fee structure protection
- Settlement event logging

### 5. Factory Attacks

**Risk**: Creation of malicious or invalid options

**Mitigations**:
- Parameter validation
- Authorized creator management
- Option tracking and monitoring
- Factory statistics validation

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality

- Comprehensive input validation
- Clear error messages and codes
- Extensive unit and integration testing
- Code review processes

### 2. State Management

- Immutable resource patterns
- Atomic operations
- Event emission for transparency
- State consistency checks

### 3. Access Control

- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based permissions
- Admin key management
- Emergency pause capabilities

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

- Comprehensive event logging
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated alerts for anomalies
- Performance metrics tracking

## Audit Considerations

### 1. Smart Contract Audit

**Scope**:
- All Move modules
- Access control mechanisms
- Economic logic validation
- Integration points

**Key Areas**:
- Oracle security and manipulation resistance
- Collateral management and liquidation procedures
- Settlement logic and fee calculations
- Factory parameter validation

### 2. Economic Audit

**Scope**:
- Pricing model validation
- Risk management procedures
- Liquidation mechanisms
- Fee structure analysis

**Key Areas**:
- Margin requirement adequacy
- Price impact on settlements
- Liquidation threshold analysis
- Fee structure sustainability

### 3. Integration Audit

**Scope**:
- External oracle integration
- Cross-module interactions
- Event system validation
- Upgrade mechanisms

**Key Areas**:
- Oracle reliability and fallbacks
- Module dependency analysis
- Event consistency validation
- Upgrade safety mechanisms

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Emergency Pause

```move
// Emergency pause functionality
public fun emergency_pause(account: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(account) == admin, E_UNAUTHORIZED);
    // Pause all operations
}
```

### 2. Emergency Withdrawal

```move
// Emergency withdrawal for users
public fun emergency_withdraw(account: &signer, user: address) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(account) == admin, E_UNAUTHORIZED);
    // Return user collateral
}
```

### 3. Oracle Fallback

```move
// Oracle fallback mechanism
public fun use_fallback_price(asset: address): u64 {
    // Use backup price source
}
```

## Security Monitoring
